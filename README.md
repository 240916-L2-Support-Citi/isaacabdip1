Log Monitoring and Alert System P1

build a log monitoring and alert system using Bash, PostgreSQL, and Python. The system will monitor logs, store them in PostgreSQL, and trigger alerts when error thresholds are reached. This project aims to simulate real-world production support tasks.


Goals
    Monitor log files for specific error levels (ERROR, FATAL).
    Insert log entries into a PostgreSQL database.
    Implement a Python-based alert system that tracks error thresholds.
    Automate log generation, monitoring, and alerting with cron jobs.
